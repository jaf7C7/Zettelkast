# The Zettelkast

+Zettelkast +Documentation

Distributed, atomic knowledge base with an emphasis on creating and
exploring links between individual ideas. Originally developed for
humanistic writing but also applicable and useful for
[technical knowledge](zet:220107053350), or really any kind of notes.

Based on the [original method][1] developed by Niklas Luhmann. Inspired
by a more modern [interpretation][2].

## The Zettelkast consists of:

The index:

* The main entry page, containing overview and inbox of unreviewed
  zettels.

The zettel archive:

* An unsorted directory of individual notes (e.g. 012345678912) containing
  a *single concept or idea*, along with inline *links to other notes*,
  and topic *tags* to expediate searching and rediscovery.

## Zettels must:

1. Represent a single idea or concept (*atomic*)
1. Record an original idea or interpretation of something actually
   understood, as opposed to merely recording arbitrary information
   (*meaningful*)
1. Always *link* to at least one other zettel (*connected*)
1. Always contain at least one *tag* (*searchable*)

## Anatomy of a zettel:

```markdown
	# An Example Zettel Title

	+Specific +Searchable +Tags

	<!-- TODO: optional todo items here with @Tags and %Priority -->

	The main body of the zettel can contain inline links to
	[other zettels](zet:012345678912) as well as reference links to
	[external][1] [resources][2].

	[1]: file:/path/to/file.pdf
	[2]: https://example.com

```

## Bibliographical zettels

An internal bibliography is maintained in special *bib notes*. These are
essentialy just ordinary zettels except they must be tagged with
`+Bibliography` along with the resource title and any other relevant tags.

When a zettel references an external resource (see above example), the
link to the resource must be appended to the bib note for that resource,
or a bib note must be created if one didn't already exist. This is a way
of getting an overview of what information has been gained from a particular
resource, as well as what resources have actually been read or watched, as
opposed to just bookmarked for later.

```markdown
	# Title Of The Book Or Domain

	+Bibliography +TitleOfResource +SomeOtherTag

	A short description of the resource, along with any comments.

	* [Multiple references][1]
	* [To the same][2]
	* [Book or domain][3]
	* [Go in this file][4]

	## Referenced by:

	* [A Zettel which references this resource](zet:123456789123)
	* [Another Zet which references this resource](zet:98496178982)

```

## Workflow

1. Write a quick zettel to record an idea you've just had or something
   you've just learned. Don't worry about making links or adding a
   bibliographical entry at this point, just get the idea in text.
1. A link to the zettel will be appended to the INDEX file. Later on sort
   through these zettels and make links between them, and append to or
   create any bibligraphical entries for external resources.
1. Course notes, active recall questions, exercises, code snippets,...
   any kind of knowledge or note can (once [properly tagged](zet:220107083835))
   be made into a zettel, as long as it adheres to
   [the criteria](#zettels-must).
