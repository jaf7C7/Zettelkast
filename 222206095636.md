# The Zettelkast

Distributed, atomic knowledge base with an emphasis on creating and exploring
links between individual ideas. The focus is on exploring what you once knew
but may have forgotten rather than encouraging [active recall][1].

Based on the [original method][2] developed by Niklas Luhmann. Inspired by
a more modern [interpretation][3].

## The Zettelkast consists of:

INDEX.md:

* The main entry page, containing overview and inbox of unreviewed
  zettels.

The zettel archive:

* Individual notes (e.g. 012345678912.md)
* Subindices (structure notes / hubs) which are lists of links to
  zettels with a common theme. Can also link to other subindices.
  All subindices are in turn listed in the main INDEX.md file.

## Zettels must:

1. Represent a single idea or concept (atomic)
1. Record an original idea or interpretation of something actually
   understood, as opposed to merely recording arbitrary information
   (meaningful)
1. Always link to at least one other zettel (connected)

## Anatomy of a zettel:

```markdown
# [012345678901] An Example Zettel Title
+specific +searchable +tags

The main body of the zettel can contain inline links to
[other zettels](zet:012345678912) as well as reference links to
[external][1] [resources][2].

```
## Workflow

1. Write a quick zettel to record an idea you've just had or something you've
   just learned. Don't worry about making links at this point, just get the
   idea in text.
1. A link to the zettel will be appended to this file. Later on sort through
   these zettels and make links (to subindices and other zettels)

## Relationship to [spaced repetition and active recall][1]

Record active recall questions somewhere else and then refer to this
Zettelkast when you need to look up the information you can't recall.
