# The Zettelkast

Distributed, atomic knowledge base with an emphasis on creating and
exploring links between individual ideas. Originally developed for
humanistic writing but also applicable and useful for
[technical knowledge](zet:220107053350), or really any kind of notes.

Based on the [original method][2] developed by Niklas Luhmann. Inspired
by a more modern [interpretation][3].

## The Zettelkast consists of:

The index:

* The main entry page, containing overview and inbox of unreviewed
  zettels.

The zettel archive:

* An unsorted directory of individual notes (e.g. 012345678912) containing
  a *single concept or idea*, along with inline *links to other notes*,
  and topic *tags* to expediate searching and rediscovery.

The bibliography:

* A subdirectory of the Zettelkast, containing a single file for each
  resource referenced in the Zettelkast, containing links to each note
  where a reference is made. This way, you can see what you have actually
  read, as opposed to what you have only planned to read, as well as
  very quickly review the knowledge you've gained from it.

## Zettels must:

1. Represent a single idea or concept (*atomic*)
1. Record an original idea or interpretation of something actually
   understood, as opposed to merely recording arbitrary information
   (*meaningful*)
1. Always *link* to at least one other zettel (*connected*)
1. Always contain at least one *tag* (*searchable*)

## Anatomy of a zettel:

```markdown
# [012345678901] An Example Zettel Title
+specific +searchable +tags

The main body of the zettel can contain inline links to
[other zettels](zet:012345678912) as well as reference links to
[external][1] [resources][2].

```
## Workflow

1. Write a quick zettel to record an idea you've just had or something you've
   just learned. Don't worry about making links at this point, just get the
   idea in text.
1. A link to the zettel will be appended to the INDEX file. Later on sort
   through these zettels and make links between them.

## Relationship to [spaced repetition and active recall][1]

Record active recall questions somewhere else and then refer to this
Zettelkast when you need to look up the information you can't recall.
