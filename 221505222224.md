## Effective strategies:

1. Active recall
1. Spaced repetition
1. Pomodoro technique (25m/5m)
1. Taking a break when you get frustrated

## Ineffective strategies:

1. Note-taking/summarising
1. Re-reading
1. Highlighting
1. Cramming
1. Powering through

## Things to try:

Split each day into several chunks on different topics rather than
grinding the whole day on one topic.

When reading/learning **write questions not notes** (See [Cornell note-taking
Method](https://lsc.cornell.edu/how-to-study/taking-notes/cornell-note-taking-system/)),
so on reviewing them you have to actively recall, and practice finding
answers quickly in the available resources.

After having understood something, practice explaining it as if to someone
else at the end of the day/session.

Revisit old topics regularly. This could mean answering questions that you
wrote, doing exercises, or projects which require revisiting that material.

Revisit after 1 day, then after 2 days, then 4 days etc. to effectively
flatten the forgetting curve. [Anki app](https://www.ankiapp.com/) will
take care of this for you.

## Questions:

* Should different techniques be used when studying for comprehension
  vs. studying for recall/revision? Note-taking can be helpful for
  comprehension in the first instance.
