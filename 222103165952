# Javascript OOP: Defining methods in a constructor vs a prototype

* If creating a large number of instances of a certain class, then prefer declaring methods
  in a prototype, as this is more memory efficient (functions declared once rather than
  multiple times).

* If creating a small number of instances of the class, defining methods in the constructor
  allows for the use of variables local only to the constructor function (methods are closures
  and the variables do not need to be defined globally).
