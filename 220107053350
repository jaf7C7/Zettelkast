# Zettelkasten for technical knowledge

+Zettelkast

You *can* put course notes on technical subjects into your
[zettelkast](zet:222206095636). If you simply use *tags* (of
the form `+<tag>`) as a sort of pseudo directory structure, then
searching for '+LearningHowToLearn' for example, will return all the
[notes](zet:221705105252) for that course, (or rather active recall
questions, and links to source material), without having the mental
labour of deciding which directory to put the notes in.

Using this method all notes, of any variety can be simply thrown
onto the heap, so to speak, while remaining searchable, connected and
rediscoverable.
